title: "Rate limiting with Redis"
description: "By Ramp Engineering"

## Use Case

- Limit requests to third-party libraries globally
    - third-party APIs have different rate limiting requirements
- Rate limiting Celery tasks globally
    - Taking action across entire userset
- Inbound traffic rate limiting for our application API
    - Cloudflare rate limit API usage by route, user IP, and other attributes
    - better to since attackers can switch IP: rate limit by app-level identities, such as authenticated user’s ID

## Old Solution

- Celery: decorators
    - Placing actions wishing to rate limit inside tasks and rate limiting the tasks themselves
        - limited: not all actions can be placed in tasks
        - For actions that could be running in task, need to handle 429 responses from third parties
- Problem: Celery rate limiting is per-worker and not global
    - Possible to hack around, but requires a task author to know
        - What queue the task is running on
        - How many Celery workers are running for a given queue
        - Worker autoscaling behavior

## Goals

- Create a general rate limiting framework in which we could test various rate limiting algorithms.
- Select an initial rate limiting algorithm that works well for most use cases

## Rate limiting Algorithms

### Fixed window

- For each time interval (eg. every hour), store and increment a counter for every successful request, and reset the counter after every interval.
    - allow up to 2x the specified rate limit in instantaneous spikes in the worst case scenario
        - e.g. with a fixed-window interval resetting at the start of every hour that allows 100 requests per interval, a user can make 100 requests at 11:59, and then make another 100 requests at 12:01.

### Sliding window

- prevent spikes, but trickier to implement, requiring to keep track of all the request times
- More memory usage and may not scale well

### Leaky bucket/token bucket

- “leaky bucket”
    - volume of bucket is set to the limit - the max number of requests for a given time interval
    - each new successful request adds a single unit to the bucket, and the bucket “leaks” (decrements) at a fixed rate. When the bucket is full, requests are denied

### Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA)

- variant of leaky bucket
- lazily computes a “theoretical arrival time” (TAT) that the next request would have to meet
- each successful request ⇒ TAT is increased by a small amount
- If TAT is larger than a pre-computed limit, requests are denied
- TAT never decreases, but pre-computed limit steadily increases as time passes to allow more requests over time

## Implementation

- use a Redis lock to prevent race conditions
- use floats instead of ints for timestamps for higher precision
- use Redis time to get current time instead of relying on server time which may differ across servers


```python
def check_allowed(self, key: str, limit: int, period: timedelta) -> bool:
    """
    Returns whether a request should be allowed

    This implementation is modified from https://dev.to/astagi/rate-limiting-using-python-and-redis-58gk

    1. uses higher precision floats instead of ints
    2. returns true for allowing instead of returning true for rejecting

    This rate limiter follows the GCRA algorithm. Resources:
